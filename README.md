eliminate conflicts with slightly reduced randomness.

Î¼Layer accelerates each NN layer by simultaneously utilizing diverse heterogeneous processors on a mobile device and by performing computations using processor-friendly quantization. First, to accelerate an NN layer using both the CPU and the GPU at the same time, Î¼Layer employs a layer distribution mechanism which completely removes redundant computations between the processors. Next, Î¼Layer optimizes the per-processor performance by making the processors utilize different data types that maximize their utilization. In addition, to minimize potential latency increases due to overly aggressive workload distribution, Î¼Layer selectively increases the distribution granularity to divergent layer paths.

Existing approaches predominately learn to embed programs from their source code, and, as a result, they do not capture deep, precise program semantics. On the other hand, models learned from runtime information critically depend on the quality of program executions, thus leading to trainedmodels with highly variant quality. LiGer learns programrepresentations from a mixture of symbolic and concrete exe-cution traces.
